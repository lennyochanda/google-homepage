# google-homepage
Deconstructing and rebuilding the google homepage frontend (The Odin Project).

In this project I got comfortable with CSS and especially positioning of elements on the page. I also used the opportunity to learn about http codes that are very handy during development. Git commands also flow naturally for me after this project (just kidding. I read most of Git's documentation though). From here I will move on to make a website (sort of) that has some interactivity using JavaScript in addition to HTML and CSS.

This was mostly coded inside Vim using python to open a simple http server hosted locally. I spent an hour wondering why my CSS changes were not reflecting on the viewport but a quick check told me that my browser was reading from cache memory, so thanks browser. I sure missed the autocomplete present in modern text editors because at the moment IDK of any autocomplete plugins for Vim (I haven't checked) but, it has forced me to be very careful and focused.


More projects to come!
Kwaheri.
